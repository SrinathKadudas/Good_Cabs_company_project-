Observations and Recommendations:


Observations:

1. There is an opportunity to improve repeated passenger rate in cities like Coimbatore, Lucknow, Surat, Vododara.
2. The average passenger rating and average driver rating decreased from January to June.
3. There is an opportunity to focus on average driver rating and average passenger rating in business cities like Vadodara, Lucknow, Surat. 
4. More revenue is generated February and March month compared to other months. so increasing the numbers of cars in those months gives more revenue. 

Recommendations:

1. Jaipur, Kochi, Chandigarh being tier 2 cities, there is an opportunity to introduce EV cars which would reduce pollution and cost of average fare per km.
2. Tourism cities like Kochi and Jaipur experience more traffic during weekends and business cities like Lucknow and Surat have more traffic during weekdays. 
It would be good to allocate cabs and drivers based on the requirement. 
3. Increase the trips or allocate more vehicles in cities like Mysore, Coimbatore, Vishakapatnam, Vadodara. 
4. Create ad campaigns and marketing in these cities or provide discount coupons or cashback to attract more customers 
5. Mysore has the high average/km which impacted the trips. Hence there is a need to reduce the fare to increase the passenger frequency.
